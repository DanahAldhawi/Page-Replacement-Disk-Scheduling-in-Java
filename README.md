## Operating Systems Algorithms â€“ Page Replacement & Disk Scheduling
## Project Overview
This project implements key operating system algorithms in Java, focusing on memory management and disk scheduling. The goal is to analyze and compare different algorithms based on their performance in terms of page faults and seek time.
## Features
**Page Replacement Algorithms:** 
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)
- Optimal Page Replacement
  
**Disk Scheduling Algorithms:**
- FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve)
- SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
- SCAN Algorithm
## Technologies Used
- Java
